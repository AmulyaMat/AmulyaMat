pursuing a degree in **Aritifical Intelligence Engineering in Biomedical Engineering.** My academic and research experiences have shaped me to become an expertise in data science and machine learning for the biomedical industry. My goal is to leverage my AI skills to revolunize the biotech and medtech platform. 

My technical toolkit is comprehensive, encompassing programming languages such as Python, C++, and MATLAB, and proficiency in essential AI frameworks like OpenCV, PyTorch, TensorFlow, PySparkML, Scikit-Learn, coupled with expertise in AWS. I am well-versed in a wide range of machine learning techniques from traditional methods like Random Forest and XGBoost to more complex models such as CNNs, GNNs, ResNET, and GANs, all of which underscore my capability to tackle intricate challenges in data science.

## Skills I possess and work on continously:

Programming Languages Python, MATLAB, C, C++, SQL, R

Machine Learning Frameworks PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-Learn, River, SHAP, MNE, PySpark ML

Data Manipulation & Vizualization Tools Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, PowerBI, Tableu, Excel

Cloud Computing Services AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda, CloudWatch), GCP, Snowflake

## Projects I have worked on:
1. Cell classification through Raman Spectroscopy
2. Caffeine Classification based on EEG signals
3. Breast MRI classification
4. Seizure detection through EEG signals
5. BCI EEG signal machine learning implementation
6. Classification of protein-bonding affinity [in progress]
